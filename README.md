# canvas-charts
## This project is used to draw the charts to display the stock of different fruits in the store, including pie charts and horizontal bar charts.
## Edit or enter the name and inventory of different fruits in the fruit.json file, then get the chart.
### The first canvas will draw a pie chart and show the proportion of each kind of fruit. 
### The second canvas draws a horizontal bar chart showing the number of fruits per fruit (up to 100).
